# __dplyr__
dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs
that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges. 

These are the main five functions within dplyr

**mutate()** adds new variables that are function of existing variables

**select()** picks variables based on their names

**filter()** picks cases based on their values

**summarise()** reduces multiple values down to a single summary

**arrange()** changes the ordering of rows
